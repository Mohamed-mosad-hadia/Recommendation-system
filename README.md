•	AI algorithms match job seekers with relevant job postings based on their profiles, skills, experiences, and preferences
•	Extract relevant features from the collected data. For users, these could include industry, skills, connections, etc. For items, features might include title, description, category, etc.
# Recommendation Algorithm
•	Collaborative Filtering: Recommend items based on user behavior and preferences by finding similar users/items.
•	Content-Based Filtering: Recommend items based on their features and similarity to what the user has liked or interacted with previously.
•	Hybrid Models: Combine collaborative and content-based approaches for better recommendations.
• Note: We employed Context-Based Filtering (CBF) in this work. 
# Evaluation
•	Measure the performance of your recommendation system using metrics like precision, recall, or user engagement.
